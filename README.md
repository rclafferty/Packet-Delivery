# Packet Delivery

Packet Delivery is currently in development as part of my master's thesis research at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. This game uses a postal service analogy to teach the DNS Lookup process by requiring the player to look up the characters' house addresses in order to successfully deliver the letters.

## Human Subject Study

Packet Delivery is currently being used in a study. Once the study has concluded, an updated build of the game will be posted and more information will be posted on my website.

If you are interested in playtesting the game or participating in the study, please email me directly and I will get you started.

## Development Roles

As part of this project, I've designed the overall concept, the educational components, and the user interface. I've prototyped the project using an on-paper proof of concept. I also programmed all scripts and pieced together animations using character art found online (cited in-game).

Character art, environment art, and some UI art were found online using sites such as https://www.opengameart.org and https://www.kenney.nl that provide art under the Creative Commons licence. The appropriate art is cited in-game on the credits screen.

## Platform Support and System Requirements

This game is only supported on Windows, Mac OSX, and WebGL. There are unofficial Android and Linux builds but will not be used in the study.

If running the game locally, a Windows 7/8/10 or Mac OSX operating system is required. It is recommended the computer has at least an Intel i5 or AMD FX 6300 processor and at least 4 GB of RAM. A graphics card will help with graphical performance but is not required to run this game.
