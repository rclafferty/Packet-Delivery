To: Mayor Clark
From: A Concerned Citizen
Prerequisite: None

Mr. Mayor,

I'm concerned about this new law you just approved on Thursday. According to the bill, you are mandating that all trees be cut down immediately. Where will all the squirrels and birds live? I'm sure there's enough room in City Hall, right?

Signed,

Someone who won't vote for you again
