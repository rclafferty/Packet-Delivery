Hey there! I really need this letter delivered today but I'm way too busy to do this.
Tanner
Can you deliver it for me? I can pay you!
Me
Sure. I have time. I can do that for you. Where is it going?
Tanner
I need you to bring it to my Uncle Doug for me.
Me
I can do that.
Tanner
I already emailed you the rest of the details.
Me
Ok but--
Tanner
Thanks! I gotta run now!
Me
But...

Me
I don't know where his Uncle Doug lives...
