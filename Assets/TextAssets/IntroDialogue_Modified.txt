Speaker: Tanner

Hey there! I really need this letter delivered today but I'm way too busy to do this.
Sounds like a rough day.
Can you deliver it for me? I can pay you!
Sure. I have time. I can do that for you. Where is it going?
I need you to bring it to my Uncle Doug for me. I already emailed you the rest of the details.
Ok but--
Thanks! I've got to run now!
I don't know where your uncle Doug lives!
